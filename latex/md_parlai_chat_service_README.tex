This is an instruction manual to be used as reference on how to configure Parl\+AI for an arbitrary chat service.

\subsection*{Message Format}

To maintain consistency we are trying to enforce a deterministic message format throughout this task. If a particular chat service doesn\textquotesingle{}t adhere to this format, one must use {\ttfamily restructure\+\_\+message()} to adapt the messages to this format before the messages are used. The message format is defined below\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\{
  mid: # ID of this message
  recipient: \{
    id: #id of message recipient
  \}
  sender: \{
    id: #id of message sender
  \}
  text: # text of the message
  attachment: # attachment of the message
\}
\end{DoxyCode}
 \subsubsection*{Additional Message fields}

These define a non-\/exhaustive list of keys that one could use in the message dict for ease-\/of-\/use
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item messaging\+\_\+type\+: whether the message is a text message or an image upload \mbox{[}R\+E\+S\+P\+O\+N\+SE, U\+P\+D\+A\+TE\mbox{]}
\item quickreplies\+: Auto-\/suggested replies
\item persona\+\_\+id\+: id of the persona that is interacting
\item name\+: Display name of the user
\item profile\+\_\+picture\+\_\+url\+: U\+RL to the profile picture of the user
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Config}

Below is the standard config format and hierarchy to be followed across all chat services\+:

```config
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item tasks\+: \# List of available tasks/worlds for a user to enter
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $<$task 1 name$>$
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item onboard\+\_\+world\+: \# World in which user is first send upon selecting the task. Can collect necessary data from user in this world, as well as provide instructions etc.
\item task\+\_\+world\+: \# Actual task world
\item timeout\+: \# Agent message timeout -\/ how long to wait for the agent to send a message before assuming they have disconnected.
\item agents\+\_\+required\+: \# Number of agents required to run the task world, e.\+g. 2 for a two player game, 1 for a one-\/player experience, etc.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item $<$task 2 name$>$
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item onboard\+\_\+world\+:
\item task\+\_\+world\+:
\item timeout\+:
\item agents\+\_\+required\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item task\+\_\+name\+: \# name of the overall task
\item world\+\_\+module\+: \# module in which all of the worlds exist (relative path i.\+e. {\ttfamily \hyperlink{namespaceparlai_1_1chat__service}{parlai.\+chat\+\_\+service}....}
\item overworld\+: \# Name of the overworld; where the agent is first sent upon messaging the service
\item max\+\_\+workers\+: \# Maximum number of workers that can be in task worlds at any given moment
\item opt\+: \# Additional model opts go here. Below are example opts that one could normally pass to parlai
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item password\+: \# Password for messaging service, if this is wanted
\item debug\+: \# whether to set debug mode
\item model\+: \# Name of model, if you want to load a model
\item model\+\_\+file\+: \# path to model file, if you want to load a model
\item override\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item model\+: \# overrides for model
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item additional\+\_\+args\+: \# Additional chat service specific args go here
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item service\+\_\+reference\+\_\+id\+: 1 \# Facebook Page id (if Messenger, else don\textquotesingle{}t include this field)
\item {\itshape any other args needed by $<$chat\+\_\+service$>$} ```
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

As one can notice, most of the format is the same as how it already exists for messenger with the exception of having {\ttfamily additional\+\_\+args\+:} as a field in our config. This has been introduced to provide flexibility of parsing any additional arguments a chat service may need whilst preserving the previously existing necessary args. Note however that {\ttfamily page\+\_\+id} has been shifted to this section to maintain coherence.
