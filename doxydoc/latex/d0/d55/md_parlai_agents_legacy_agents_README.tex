In this directory, you will find older implementations of agents we have kept for posterity. These agents are deprecated, and we do not make any guarantees of maintaining their functionality -\/ that is, models may not be backwards-\/compatible with older versions.

\subsection*{How to use}

To use a legacy agent, one must specify the model version along with the keyword {\ttfamily legacy}, e.\+g. as below\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
python examples/train\_model.py -m legacy:memnn:0
\end{DoxyCode}
