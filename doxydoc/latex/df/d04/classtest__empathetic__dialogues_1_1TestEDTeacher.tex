\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Basic tests to count the number of examples/episodes and to check a few utterances.

# Counting num episodes (from the original internal copy of the data)

# We count the number of lines with turn_idx=2 because this means that we have at
# least one full utterance in the conversation. For train_experiencer_only==False,
# we also include turn_idx=3 to count the Listener-based conversations in the same
# manner.
