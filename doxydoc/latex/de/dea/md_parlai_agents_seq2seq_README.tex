The Seq2\+Seq agent takes an input sequence and produces an output sequence.

The agent supports encoding and decoding via a variety of R\+NN flavors, including L\+S\+T\+Ms and G\+R\+Us. The agent supports encoding and decoding via a variety of R\+NN flavors, including L\+S\+T\+Ms and G\+R\+Us. Decoding can be done via greedy.
